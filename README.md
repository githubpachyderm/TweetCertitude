# TweetCertitude
This is a non-automatic Twitter bot that replies to its mentions with the most popular tweet from a given account mentioning a given keyword or phrase.

For example, if you tweet this: "@TweetCertitude @POTUS student", the bot, once run, will reply to your tweet with the text and media from the most popular tweet in the most recent 200 tweets from @POTUS that contains the word "student."

This is an easy way to fact-check what really goes on in Twitter, a platform often regarded as a global public square and a primary mover and shaker in the realm of American news, without having to hassle with the API on the user's end.
